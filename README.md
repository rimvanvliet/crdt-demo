# Install
- you will need node and npm (see https://nodejs.org/);
- you will need browserify to make the package runable in a brwoser (`npm install -g browserify`);
- you will need the dependent node packages (`npm install` in the crdt-demo folder);
- you will need to brwserify the package (`browserify src/crdtDemo.js > build/crdtDemoBrowserified.js` in the crdt-demo folder);
- load `index.html` in a browser.
